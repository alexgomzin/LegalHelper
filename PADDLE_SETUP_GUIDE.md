## Overview
This guide will help you complete the Paddle payment integration for your LegalHelper application.

## ‚úÖ What's Already Completed

1. **Frontend Components**
   - PaddleProvider component for SDK loading
   - Test page for Paddle functionality
   - Checkout page with Paddle integration
   - Pricing page with purchase buttons

2. **Backend APIs**

3. **Database Schema**
   - User profiles with Paddle fields

   - Webhook logging system

## üîß What You Need To Do Next

### Step 1: Update Your Render Environment Variables

Make sure all these environment variables are set in your Render dashboard:

```bash
# Paddle Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_PADDLE_VENDOR_ID=YOUR_VENDOR_ID_HERE
NEXT_PUBLIC_PADDLE_ENVIRONMENT=sandbox  # or 'production' for live
NEXT_PUBLIC_PADDLE_PAY_PER_DOCUMENT=YOUR_PRODUCT_ID_HERE
NEXT_PUBLIC_PADDLE_5_PACK=YOUR_PRODUCT_ID_HERE
NEXT_PUBLIC_PADDLE_15_PACK=YOUR_PRODUCT_ID_HERE
NEXT_PUBLIC_PADDLE_30_PACK=YOUR_PRODUCT_ID_HERE
NEXT_PUBLIC_PADDLE_SUBSCRIPTION=YOUR_PRODUCT_ID_HERE
```

### Step 2: Configure Webhook in Paddle Dashboard

1. Go to your Paddle Dashboard
2. Navigate to **Developer Tools ‚Üí Notifications** (not "Webhooks")
3. Click **"+ New destination"** to create a new webhook endpoint
4. Fill in the details:
   - **Description**: "LegalHelper Webhook Handler"
   - **URL**: `https://your-app.onrender.com/api/payment/webhook`
   - **Notification Type**: Select "webhook" from the dropdown
   - **Events**: Select these important events:
     - `transaction.completed` (for one-time purchases)
     - `transaction.created`
     - `subscription.created`
     - `subscription.updated`
     - `subscription.canceled`
     - `subscription.past_due`
     - `payment.succeeded`
     - `payment.failed`
5. **Save destination**

### Important Notes:
- Paddle now calls webhooks "Notifications"
- Make sure to select "webhook" as the notification type (not email)
- Your webhook URL should be publicly accessible
- Start with sandbox/test mode first

### Step 3: Run Database Migrations

Apply the payment-related database migrations:

```bash
# If using Supabase, run the SQL migrations
# The payments.sql file has been updated with all required tables
```

### Step 4: Test the Integration

1. **Test Configuration**: Visit `/api/test-paddle` to verify all environment variables
2. **Test Checkout**: Visit `/test-paddle` to test the payment flow
3. **Test Webhook**: Use Paddle's webhook testing tools

### Step 5: Update Product IDs

Replace the product IDs in your Paddle dashboard with your actual ones:

1. **Pay-per-document**: $1.50 one-time payment
2. **5-pack**: $5.50 for 5 analysis credits
3. **15-pack**: $12.00 for 15 analysis credits
4. **30-pack**: $22.50 for 30 analysis credits
5. **Subscription**: $30.00/month for 50 credits
